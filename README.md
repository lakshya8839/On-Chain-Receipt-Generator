# On-Chain-Receipt-Generator
**On-Chain Receipt Generator** is a decentralized smart contract that **records and issues receipts** for transactions on the blockchain. It ensures **secure, transparent, and immutable** tracking of payments.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
âœ… **Automatic Receipt Issuance** â€“ Every ETH transaction gets logged on-chain.  
âœ… **Transparent Records** â€“ View past transactions with sender, amount, and timestamp.  
âœ… **Event Emission** â€“ Listen to `ReceiptIssued` events for off-chain tracking.  
âœ… **No Deployment Inputs** â€“ Works immediately upon deployment with no setup needed.  
âœ… **Simple & Gas Efficient** â€“ Optimized contract with minimal storage costs.  

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works  
1. Send ETH to the contract using the `issueReceipt()` function.  
2. The contract stores the sender, amount, and timestamp.  
3. Retrieve past receipts using `getReceipt(index)`.  
4. Track all receipts using `getTotalReceipts()`.  

## ðŸŒŽ Deployed Contract  
**Network:** EDU Chain  
**Deployed Address:** `your deployed address from Remix`  

## ðŸ”— Usage  
### **Connect to the Contract**  
Use Web3 tools like **MetaMask**, **Remix**, or **Etherscan** to interact.  

### **View Receipts**  
- Call `getTotalReceipts()` to check how many receipts exist.  
- Use `getReceipt(index)` to retrieve a specific transaction.  

### **Listen for Transactions (Off-Chain)**  
Monitor new transactions with:  
```solidity
event ReceiptIssued(address indexed sender, uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp);
